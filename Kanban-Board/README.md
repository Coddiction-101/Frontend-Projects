# 🗂️ Kanban Form Project

> **Status:** 🚧 In Production / Work in Progress

A lightweight, beginner-friendly **Kanban-style task management project** focused on learning **core frontend fundamentals** while building something practical and extensible. This project is intentionally evolving in public as part of a structured learning journey.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The **Kanban Form Project** allows users to create, manage, and move tasks across different stages of work (e.g., *To Do*, *In Progress*, *Done*) using a simple form-driven interface.

The goal is **not just task management**, but to:

* Practice clean HTML structure
* Strengthen JavaScript logic
* Understand state handling without frameworks
* Learn UI/UX decisions incrementally

---

## 🎯 Core Goals

* Learn by building (project-first approach)
* Avoid frameworks initially (Vanilla JS only)
* Keep logic readable and modular
* Improve UI step-by-step instead of overengineering

---

## ⚙️ Current Features (Implemented / In Progress)

* ✅ Task creation using a form
* ✅ Basic Kanban columns
* ✅ Dynamic task rendering
* 🚧 Task movement between columns
* 🚧 Input validation & UX improvements

---

## 🧪 Planned Features

> These will be added iteratively as learning progresses

* ⏳ Drag and drop support
* 💾 LocalStorage persistence
* 🏷️ Task priority & tags
* 🕒 Timestamps (created / updated)
* 🔍 Task filtering & search
* 🎨 Theme support (light / dark)
* 📱 Improved responsiveness

---

## 🧱 Tech Stack

* **HTML5** – semantic structure
* **CSS3** – layout & styling
* **JavaScript (ES6+)** – logic & interactivity

> No frameworks, no libraries (for now)
